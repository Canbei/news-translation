I got offers from Google, Lyft, Yelp, cloud unicorn Rubrik, IBM Artificial Intelligence, and JP Morgan Chase. My story may help you in your job search.
找工作时我曾拿到了包括谷歌、Lyft、Yelp、云独角兽公司Rubrik、IBM人工智能部门和摩根大通集团在内的工作offer，希望我的求职故事对你有所启发。

### Introduction简要概述

I hope my story inspires current software engineering job seekers - especially from non-traditional backgrounds.我希望我的求职故事能激励正在找软件工程领域工作的同仁---特别是那些非专业科班背景的朋友。

You may be thinking “how likely is it that I could pull this off too?” In this article, I'll be specific about my decisions and thought processes. I'll also give links for further reading.你可能会想：你怎么可能八个月就做到？在这篇文章中，我会对我的决策过程和思考过程详细介绍，也会提供进一步的阅读资料。

First, I must acknowledge that I have benefited from significant privilege: I am a white, straight, cis, male with a bachelor’s degree from a top 20 US university. I had also built up a network after three years of working in the San Francisco Bay Area.
首先，我必须承认，我是个白人，直男，本科就读于美国国内排名前20的高校。在旧金山湾区工作的三年也让我积累了自己的人脉。
Every job seeker's story will be different, but I hope yours benefits from mine.
每个求职者的故事都不太一样，希望我的故事也能对你有所启发。
## **Deciding to take the plunge**决定冒险

On July 29th, 2018, I made an irrational decision.2018年7月29日，我做了一个不理智的决定。

I was choosing between a Chief of Staff role for a hyper-growth adtech company and attending a  [coding “bootcamp.”][1]  The Chief of Staff role was lucrative and certain - seemingly an extraordinary ticket to a Silicon Valley fast track. The bootcamp seemed expensive and risky.我面临着两个选择：一是去一家快速增长广告技术公司担任办公室主任，二是参加编程训练营。办公室主任一职薪水颇丰，发展稳定，似乎还是进入硅谷工作的快速通道。编程训练营看起来代价又高、风险又大。

I had written my first line of JavaScript five weeks earlier on June 24th with no intention of becoming an engineer. I already had a degree in Economics and three years’ experience as a non-technical management consultant for nonprofits. I just wanted to make myself a more attractive candidate for roles that involved working with engineers in the Bay Area.6月24日，也就是5周前，我才用Javascript写下了我的第一行代码，但也并没有打算成为一名工程师。本科时，我读的专业是经济学，过去三年在一家非盈利机构做非技术管理咨询的工作。在湾区，有些职位要跟工程师一起工作，我只是想让自己竞争这些岗位时更有竞争力。

Actually becoming an engineer seemed like a moonshot idea. I had heard stories of people self-teaching and using bootcamps to do so in under a year. But I struggled to believe that I could do the same.事实上，成为一名工程师像是天方夜谭。尽管我之前听说过许多人用一年时间用编程训练营自学了编程，但我还是很难相信自己也可以做到同样水平。

Most engineers I knew had four-year computer science degrees, years of experience, and seemed to speak a foreign language. How could I learn all that in so little time? Plus, doing so would require I throw out my career-to-date in operations and strategy — a high cost for an uncertain reward.据我了解，大多数工程师本科专业就是计算机科学，他们有着多年的工作经验，还会讲一门外语，我怎么能在这么短的时间内学会这么多东西呢？另外，要是我选择学习编程，我就要舍弃掉我的职业生涯，为一个不确定的回报冒这么高的风险，值得吗？

The Chief of Staff role, on the other hand, looked like a dream come true. I would be the most junior member by ~10 years in “the room where it happens” as the company navigated upcoming acquisition talks. Salary negotiations went better than expected, and it seemed I would likely inherit a department of my own after a few years.办公室主任一职，则更像是梦想实现了。公司正在准备不久后的合并事宜，不超十年，我将成为一家大公司的员工。给出的薪水比预想的要好，几年后我也有希望领导自己的团队。

But once I started coding I didn’t want to stop. I loved the technical challenge, was thrilled to make headway against something so intimidating. And I figured  [developing a second professional skillset][2]  might prepare me for an unusually impactful career.但是，开始编程后，我就不想停下来。我热爱技术挑战，喜欢迎难而上。我还发现，发展第二个职业技能[developing a second professional skillset][2]让我做足准备，开启一段不平凡、有影响的职业生涯。

An inner voice also asked if becoming an engineer would be as personally transformational as professional:  _If I succeed in learning this, what couldn’t I learn?_  This attitude, more than anything else, would become the theme of my journey.我内心里也有个声音在问：成为一名工程师会不会既能提升专业度，又能完成个人转型？如果我能学会编程，有什么是我学不会的呢？正是这种学习态度，支撑我坚持走完了整个旅程。

I took an online course and, after coding ~40 hours/week for three weeks, I decided to apply to  [Hack Reactor][3], which I had heard described as “the Harvard of bootcamps,” just to see if I could get in. I passed the entrance exam by the skin of my teeth the same week I received the Chief of Staff offer.我选择了线上的编程课，连续三周每周编程时间不低于40个小时，之后我申请了被誉为“哈佛编程训练营”的黑客反应堆[Hack Reactor][3],想试试看我是否能成为其中的一份子。侥幸通过测试后，同一周，我拿到了办公室主任的工作offer。

After 72 hours of soul searching I checked my bank account one last time. I estimated I would have three months’ rent and food after Hack Reactor.  _Just enough time to find a job,_  I thought.72小时的自我反省后，我最后一次查看了自己的银行账户。算了算黑客反应堆项目结束后，我还有三个月的房租和相应的食物开支。我想，时间足够我找到工作了。

I chose bootcamp.我选择了编程训练营。

I declined by phone with the adtech company, hung up, and was hit by a wave of mixed emotions. Part of me was scared:  _I’m throwing away a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a moonshot idea!_ Another part excited:  _The only thing that stands between me and regret is taking risks!_我给广告技术公司打电话拒绝了他们的offer。挂断电话以后我的情绪很复杂，一方面我很害怕：我可是为一个疯狂的决定放弃了一生仅一次的工作机会！另一方面我又激情满满：为了不让自己后悔，冒险前进吧！

Soon my excitement won out. No turning back now – I was in for an adventure.没多久我的激情就消耗殆尽了。不过再没有回头路了：我已经踏上了冒险旅程。

## **Learning to code**学习编程

> **“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” –Zig Ziglar**不必一开始就优秀，但你要学着优秀。---齐格*齐格勒

Hack Reactor and other “bootcamps” aspire to do in three months much of what traditional university CS programs do in four years: prepare students to compete for top-tier software engineering jobs.黑客反应堆和其他编程训练营都力求在三个月完成传统大学计算机科学专业需要四年才能完成的任务：让学生做好准备，竞争顶级软件工程工作。

The goal is ambitious, and every moment counts. For 12-14 hours/day, 6 days/week over the course of 3 months, the program threw us repeatedly into overwhelming tasks against tight time constraints.目标很宏大，所以得分秒必争。三个月的课程安排中，一周六天，一天上12-14小时的课，时间很紧，所以我们每天都面临大量的任务。

At the start of every assignment I would get a sickening pit in my stomach and think,  _This deadline seems impossible – I don’t even know where to start_! But somehow I would (almost) always hack together a working solution just as time expired.每次下达任务时，我都会心里一惊：这根本不可能在截止期限完成！我连在哪儿下手都没有头绪。但很神奇，每次到截止期限时，我总是能想出来或基本想出来一个解决方案。

After enough reps, I started to associate the pit in my stomach with a sense of excitement — the more impossible the challenge seemed, the more satisfying it would be to find a solution.经历足够的震惊之后，我开始感到一丝丝的激动：挑战看起来有多不可能，找到解决方案的时候就有多心满意足。

Hack Reactor wasn’t just teaching content, it was teaching a new kind of  rit[grit][4]  and  [growth mindset][5], and the process was exhilarating.黑客反应堆不仅仅教授编程知识，它还会教给我们咬紧牙关坚持的精神[grit][4]，以及成长型思维[growth mindset][5]。过程十分令人激动。

Still doubting I would get a job before my savings ran out, I invested in the best learning and self-care habits I could find.仍然怀疑我是否能在存款用完之前烧到工作，我选择了最好的学习课程，养成了我能找到的自我关心习惯。

To ensure ample  [sleep for learning][6], I kept strict bedtimes.充足的睡眠才能保证学习效率[sleep for learning][6]，因此我制定了严格的睡眠时间。

To fight repetitive stress aches,  [boost wellbeing][7], and  [support learning][8], I worked out every other day.为了缓解经常性压力，每隔一天我都会锻炼身体促进健康、支持学习。

To improve retention and make each day’s learning a little better than the last, I reviewed core lessons and reflected on what went well and what did not most evenings.为了提升记忆力、让每一天的学习都比前一天有进步，几乎每天晚上我都会复习核心课程，思考哪些事情做得比较好，哪些还不够好。

And most importantly, to maintain baseline wellbeing during such an intense schedule, I meditated for a full hour every morning before class, usually using a mix of vipassana (a form of  [body scanning][9]) and  [loving-kindness][10]  techniques.最重要的是，为了在一个如此紧张的安排中保持基本健康水平，每天早上上课之前我都会花一个小时来冥想，结合内观（一种身体审视形式[body scanning][9]）和慈爱[loving-kindness][10]冥想。

This last habit may strike some as extreme, but the  [evidence behind meditation][11]  improving wellbeing is strong, especially  [loving-kindness][12]. I cannot overstate how valuable this practice was in helping me embrace the curiosity and joy of learning rather than grow anxious about the challenges of bootcamp and uncertain employment.最后一个习惯可能会震撼一些人，但是冥想能改善健康的证据[evidence behind meditation][11]十分充足,尤其是慈爱冥想 [loving-kindness][12]。它帮助我保持对编程学习的好奇和愉悦，缓解了我面对编程学习挑战和工作的不确定性时的忧虑，对我来说十分有价值，但我又不能过于夸大它的价值。

I also benefited from a blessing in disguise. A travel conflict prevented me from enrolling in the in-person immersive, so despite living a 10-minute walk from the SF campus, I had to take the remote program. Between the lack of commute, easy access to food, and the quiet of my apartment, I was able to protect another ~90 minutes a day of uninterrupted  [deep work][13].我也确实因祸得福。因为差旅冲突我没有选择面对面授课。所以尽管我离斯坦福校园步行只需十分钟，我不得不选择了更远的项目---网课。但因为我上课无需通勤，吃饭方便，公寓环境十分安静，一天中，我又多出了90分钟不被打扰的深层学习时间。

The first six weeks involved two-day pair programming sprints building on semi-completed code repositories. We raced through rewriting the JavaScript  [Underscore][14]  library, building basic data structures from scratch, learning object-oriented vs. functional programming, calculating time and space complexity, and wiring up a full stack app from client to server to database. Our smaller, 24-person cohort grew close joking with one another over video conference 10+ hours/day.刚开始的六周，有两天是在未完成代码库的基础上，进行结对子的编程冲刺。两天时间里，我们重写了Javascript强调[Underscore][14]图书馆，从零开始建立了基础数据结构，学习了结构导向编程和功能编程，计算了时间和空间复杂度，接通了从客户到服务器到数据库的全栈APP应用。我们这支24人队伍，每天视频会议时间不下10小时，期间开开玩笑，关系走得日渐亲近。

Three weeks in, I was afraid I wasn’t going to pass the gating mid-course assessment, so I  [wrote a letter to myself][15]  dated in the future explaining how it came to be that I passed the assessment.学习了三周以后，我担心我可能不会通过中期考评，所以我给未来的自己写了一封信，告诉自己要想通过考评需要如何做。

I mentioned all my existing self-care and learning habits and added a few more, including reviewing code I didn’t fully understand until I could mentally explain the core concepts to an imaginary 8 year-old (the  [Feynman Technique][16]).我提到了我现有的自我关心和学习习惯，又增加了一些新的习惯，比如，有能力在脑海里给一个虚构的小女孩[Feynman Technique][16]解释核心代码之前，复习这些我没有完全理解的代码。

Three weeks later, I built my first full stack application from scratch in under 24 hours and passed the exam with flying colors. College was a great education. This was another level.三周以后，在24小时内，我从零建立起了自己的第一个全栈应用，出色地通过了考评。大学教育十分重要，但这里的教育是另一个世界。

The second six weeks involved more free-form group projects. Taking inspiration from  [positive deviance][17], I tracked down and got in touch with bootcamp alumni who were especially successful in the job search. I followed their guidance to set tight personal deadlines for intimidating technical challenges, select “hot” skills on the job market (like working with Docker and microservices), and diversifying my roles across different projects. I arranged a tutoring session with one alum and successfully implemented a feature that originally took him weeks in two days.第二个六周里，有更多的自由形式小组项目。我从正向偏差中汲取灵感，追随着训练营营友的步伐，跟他们进行了交流。这些营友找的工作都十分成功。根据他们的指导建议，我设定了严格的deadline以应对巨大的技术挑战；在求职市场上挑选出最受欢迎的职业技能，例如能使用Docker和微服务系统工作；在不同的项目中扮演不同的角色。我还请一个营友对我进行了一次辅导，我用两天的时间成功运行一项性能，这位营友却花费了数周时间。

Hack Reactor hires some of its graduates from each cohort to serve as temporary, part-time teaching assistants to support full-time staff. After graduation, I took a 6-week position working ~35 hours/week and helped roll out new curriculum, conducted independent research, lectured job-seeking alumni on my findings, and interviewed incoming Hack Reactor candidates.黑客反应堆会从每支队伍的结业营员中雇佣一些作为短期兼职助教，来支持全职员工的工作。结业以后，我在这里担任了六周的助教，每周工作35个小时。工作内容包括：帮助制定课程安排，进行独立调研，基于调研结果帮助在找工作的营员，面试前来应聘黑客反应堆的候选人。

I negotiated a 6-week position as opposed to the typical 12-week position to give me exposure to the new curriculum while limiting the delay in job searching and studying full-time. I was grateful to learn on the job ([teaching in particular boosted my own learning][18]) and the modest pay bought me two more months of living expenses – a big relief!我跟训练营负责人商量了只做六周的助教，而不是十二周。助教工作让我接触到了新的课程，同时也让我兼顾找工作和全职学习两件事，没有太多耽搁。非常感激能在助教工作中学习，助教工作确实进一步加深了我自己的学习[teaching in particular boosted my own learning][18]，开出的薪水也足够我两个多月的开支，极大地缓解了我的压力。

Companies that made me offers给我工作offer的公司

On December 7, 165 days after my first line of code, my employment with Hack Reactor ended, leaving me with savings to pay for four months’ rent and food. Hack Reactor warns its graduates to budget six months for job searching. The clock was ticking!12月7日，距离我写下第一行代码已经过去了165天，我的黑客反应堆训练营也结束了，剩下的存款还够我承担四个月的房租和生活开支。训练营告诉营员要预留6个月的时间来找工作。倒计时开始啦！

I wrote down my goals. I was ambitious and the odds were stacked against me.  I wanted:我想要一展宏图，即使困难重重。所以我给自己制定的目标如下：

-   A top 25th-percentile Hack Reactor outcome in compensation, hoping for over $120K/annual salary薪水排名最低也要拿到训练营的前25%，目标是年薪超过12万美金
-   The steepest possible learning curve; ideally in a role with both autonomy and access to experienced mentors工作尽可能具备最刺激的学习体验，希望职位既能让我充分发挥主观能动性，也有机会接触到行业大牛
-   A team and company culture that was technically strong but people-first工作团队和公司的文化以技术为重，同时要以人为本
-   Interesting and meaningful work工作要有趣也有意义
-   A back end role, or at least full stack, which were less common than front end roles landed by bootcamp grads后端工作，至少要是全栈开发。这要比训练营结业营员面试的前端工作更有竞争力

I never imagined I would get everything I wanted and more. But the search would be a rollercoaster of ups and downs.我从未设想过我的目标能全部实现。但我知道找工作一定会像过山车一般起伏不定

Hack Reactor left me with a terrific foundation in little time, but I was still weeks, if not months, of full-time study away from where I needed to be to interview successfully at top companies.黑客训练营只留给我很少的时间，而且我还有几周---虽然不是几个月---要全职学习，这让我没办法去顶级公司面试。

I would also have to face relentless, ongoing rejection with no certainty of success. Hiring from coding bootcamps is not yet mainstream, and despite suggesting bootcamps grads perform just as well as those with four-year CS degrees in interviews][19], it would be an uphill battle to land  [evidence interviews. And the vastness of topics covered in software engineering interviews meant I could never be completely prepared.我也不得不面对即将到来的无休止的没有确切成功可能性的拒绝。尽管调查证据显示，在面试中，训练营营员跟四年计算机专业科班出身的学生表现一样优秀[evidence suggesting bootcamps grads perform just as well as those with four-year CS degrees in interviews][19]，雇佣编程训练营营员仍然不是主流。

When it was all over, I had applied to 44 companies with 41 referrals and received 14 coding challenges or technical phone interviews, which converted to 8 on-sites and 7 offers by February 15, 2019 - 245 days after my first line of code.等到找工作终于尘埃落定，我总共申请了44家公司，其中41家是熟人帮忙介绍；遇见了14次或编程挑战或技术电话面试，其中有8次进入了现场面试，截止2019年2月15日，我共收到了7个offer。这距离我写下第一行代码，已经过去了245天。

## Beginning the search and learning from failure开始找工作：从失败中汲取教训

> **"Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and attended to with diligence." ―Abigail Adams** 学习不是偶然获得的，必须用热爱去追求，用勤奋去对待。---阿比盖尔*亚当斯

My first weeks of job searching were the toughest. I landed only a handful of coding challenges and an interview with IBM Artificial Intelligence throughout all of December.最刚开始找工作的几周是最艰难的。十二月一整月，我只做了几个编程测试，只拿到了IBM人工智能的面试机会。

Feedback on my first two take-home coding challenges was not encouraging. I went way over time, and was told my code was “neither accurate nor performant.”结业后在家完成的前两个编程测试反馈就不如人意。我花时间修改了一下，被告知我的代码“既不准确又不高性能”。

My third coding challenge was a multi-hour, heart-thumping affair in which I passed all tests with seconds to spare but failed to click submit before time expired!第三个编程测试有几个小时的时间，但我仍然心跳加速。我在时间结束前几秒完成了测试，却没来得及点击提交！

I told myself it was a numbers game, and every morning after my hour of loving-kindness meditation, I’d take a minute to remind myself of two things:我告诉自己量变才能引起质变，现在我需要积累。每个早上一个小时的慈爱冥想结束后，我都会花一分钟提醒自己两件事：

-   First, while my goals gave me direction, overly focusing on goals would only leave me dissatisfied with the gap between where I was and where I wanted to be. I wanted  [habits over goals][20].第一，目标确实给人方向。但如果只关注目标，在面对自己当前的水准和想要达到的目标之间的巨大差距时，我就会十分不满和沮丧。我想要超越目标的习惯[habits over goals][20]。
-   Second, I reflected that regardless of what job landed, the real prize of this journey was personal, not professional, transformation. I was lucky to have months dedicated full-time to learning how to learn, and I was falling in love with it!第二，我认为，不管面试的是什么工作，经历的真正价值在于个人提升而非专业提升。很幸运能用几个月的时间全职学习如何学习，我现在也完全沉迷于此。

I knew early failures could be seeds for later success, but they would require special care. I made sure to do a post-mortem on every failed coding challenge and interview, then redo the problem in my text editor until I solved it. One 20-minute prompt took me 9 hours over three days to solve!我知道失败是成功之母，但前提是你认真对待失败。每次编程测试或者面试失败后，我都会进行事后反省，然后在我的文本编辑器里再次开始解决问题直到完全解决。20分钟的提示要花我3天9个小时来解决！

I kept notes on new concepts and “aha” moments after I solved a problem, treating them as my invaluable collection of “[mental models][21]” I hoped would grow sufficient to pattern match to any interview prompt. I would review them on  [spaced repetition intervals][22]  to most efficiently commit to long-term memory.每解决一个问题，我都会记录下新概念和惊喜时刻，把它们看做是我心智模型[mental models][21]。我希望会面对面试提示时能有足够多的模式匹配。我会按照记忆重复间隔[spaced repetition intervals][22]定期回顾它们，以便转成长期记忆。

For problems involving new code syntax, I’d redo them under time pressure to ensure accurate recall in an interview setting.如果问题涉及新的编程句法结构，我会把问题按照时间紧急程度重做一遍，这样才能保证，面试再次碰到这些问题时轻松应对。

These habits did more than enhance retention — they built reassuring confidence. I didn’t know if I’d land a job before money ran out, but it was satisfying that even my greatest disappointments were making me better.这些习惯不仅仅是增强了我的记忆力，他们还建立了我的自信。我不知道在积蓄花完之前我能否找到一份工作，我知道但哪怕是最失望的经历也在帮助我变得更好，这种感觉让我知足。

I settled into a steady routine, ~8 hours a day, 5+ days/week: study and/or interview, diagnose failure/success, reflect, repeat.我的每日规划十分平稳，一周不少于五天，每天八小时：学习or面试，总结失败or成功经验，思考，重复。

I curated and constantly revised my study plans by first getting a sense for what strong performance looked like in each of the different types of interviews I might encounter (data structure/algorithms, front end DOM manipulation, systems design, etc.). Then I’d estimate the probability of encountering each type in upcoming interviews and weigh that against my self-assessment of my performance to decide what to study next.面试中我可能会遇到诸如数据结构、算法、前端DOM操作、系统设计等等。按照这些可能，我不断地调整自己的学习计划以便面试时呈现最佳表现。之后我会预估接下来的面试遇到各种类型考题的可能性有多大，评估自己的面试表现，决定下一步的学习任务。

Wanting to ensure I only used the best resources, I kept lists of peer-recommended resources organized by topic. When it was time to study that topic, I’d supplement the list with anything new from a quick Google search and then skim each resource to determine the best one or two before diving deep into those. I’d do most prioritization the day before so I could go straight from my morning meditation into 2-3 hours of uninterrupted deep work the next day.为了确保用到最好的学习资源，我按照主题分门别类，整理了同好们推荐的各种资源，列成清单。需要学习这个主题时，我会再去谷歌快速搜索一下，看看有没有什么新的资源可以更新到清单上，然后找出最好的一到两个资源进行深入学习。前一天我会做好各项事件优先级排序，第二天就能确保，清晨冥想之后，进行2-3个小时的不被打扰的深入学习。

I spent another 2-3 hours/day building a pipeline of attractive companies, generating referrals, and submitting applications. It took more time than I liked to complete a single application and I had a limited number of top picks, so I did my best to increase app-to-interview conversation rates by每天我还会花2-3个小时寻找目标公司，找出重点目标，然后投递简历。每次投递简历花费的时间比我预想的要多，而且可供我选择的顶级公司数量有限，因此，我尽我所能通过以下方式提升我从投递简历到拿到面试机会的概率：

-   [emphasizing results][23] over context or action in my resume,简历中强调自己工作取得的成果或者采取的行动
-   studying which of my approaches and messages generated referrals fastest via email and LinkedIn,研究邮件和领英哪个渠道和信息流能最快给我推荐相关公司
-   tracking my entire pipeline in a spreadsheet, and整个流程写在电子表格上随时回顾
-   following up on all communications.跟进所有正在进行的沟通

I treated most applications as experiments in improving return for time invested. Habits paid off here too — steadily putting companies in my pipeline meant that I could immediately look ahead to the next opportunity when I received a rejection.我几乎把所有投递简历的过程当做实验，希望投入时间带来的回报能不断提高。我的好习惯也帮了我很多---把已投递简历的公司写入表格意味着，在我被拒绝之后，我可以立即寻找下一个机会。

I also did my best to time applications so I could interview first with less desirable companies while pushing along slower moving processes (like Google’s).我也尽可能地安排好时间，首先面试意愿度低一些的公司，缓慢推进意愿度高的公司的面试进程，比如谷歌。

My interview with IBM proved to be a bright spot to my rocky start, but even still, it doubled as a lesson to persist amidst uncertainty. It consisted of a phone interview and three more interviews at the “on-site.”IBM的面试是我坎坷求职之路上的转折点。直到现在，这次面试也给我上了一堂课，教会我如何处理不确定性。面试包括一次电话面试和三次现场面试。

At the start of every interview I experienced that now-familiar pit in my stomach and thought:  _I do not know how to do this_.每次面试一开始，我都会经历那种现在无比熟悉的感觉，默默对自己说：我不知道怎么做。

I responded each time by taking a breath and reminding myself:  _It’s fun turning this feeling into a working solution at home, so imagine how much more fun it will be here where the stakes are higher and the job is on the line!_但我每次都会深呼吸，提醒自己：在家中，从不知所措到想出解决方案都如此有趣，所以，在这里---风险更高，工作触手可及---想出解决方案的那种感觉该会有多美妙！

After the first two interviews, I wondered if my excitement and learning orientation were contagious — my interviewers certainly knew I didn’t see an answer right away, but they seemed to enjoy how the energy in the conversation rose as I neared a solution.前两次面试之后，我想知道我的激动心情和学习导向是否有感染力。面试官当然知道我并没有一开始就找到答案，但他们似乎很享受我在接近解决方案时话语间体现出的活力。

I left IBM encouraged that, while I may not always crack an interview prompt, I could always enjoy sharing a growth mindset under pressure. I’m sure this mentality helped me convert seven of eight on-sites.面试结束离开IBM的时候，我给自己加油打气：就算没有拿下这份工作，我也很享受压力下的思维提升。我坚信我这种信念会帮助我找到工作。

Fortunately, seeds sown in December’s failures bloomed into January's success.幸运的是，十二月份的失败浇灌了一月份的成功之花。

## Building momentum and early success良好势头和早期成果

> **"Your hardest times often lead to the greatest moments of your life. Keep going." ―Roy T. Bennet**最艰难的日子过后就是你人生的高光时刻，继续前进吧。---罗伊T*本尼特

The first week of January, IBM called with an informal offer with formal details forthcoming.  _Could I use this as leverage in the meantime?_  I thought. I shared the news with a Google recruiter, who responded by accelerating me past the phone interview straight to an on-site.一月份的第一周，IBM打电话通知我被录用了，具体的正式录用细节会之后另行通知。“我可以利用一下这个offer吗？”，我问自己。随后我跟谷歌招聘人员分享了我拿到IBMoffer的消息，他回复说让我跳过电话面试直接现场面试。

Suddenly, I could command recruiters’ attention. I immediately informed all companies I was speaking with that I had an offer. Doing so during the start of the new year immediately heated up my pipeline.突然我就引起了招聘人员的关注。我立即跟所有我正在联系的公司说明了我已经拿到IBMoffer的消息。新年伊始，整个找工作的节奏就这样被调动起来了。

The next week, I felt confident for the first time in all four technical interviews at a JP Morgan Chase on-site, finishing most of them with time to spare. I was overjoyed my work in December had so clearly paid off.第二周，去参加摩根大通的四场现场技术面试时，我第一次信心满满，甚至还提前完成了任务。十二月的辛苦付出终于有了收获，我欣喜若狂。

My Google on-site was a few days later. The difference in difficulty was shocking. I performed terribly in my second interview involving asynchronous JavaScript promises.几天以后是谷歌面试，难度令人咋舌。第二场面试涉及到异步JavaScript promise，我发挥得很差。

I took a moment in the restroom at the lunch break to regroup with a micro-meditation. I figured I had almost no shot at a job offer, so the objective was now to learn as much as possible from my failure.午饭休息时间，我在休息室里花了一点时间，稍作休整。判断了一下形势觉得自己无望拿到offer，我决定把目标调整成尽可能地从失败中多学经验。

I knew I’d do a post-mortem in the evening. In the meantime, I challenged myself to see how much gratitude and equanimity I could cultivate in such a high-stakes environment. After all, how exciting was it I was interviewing at Google?我知道晚上回家后我要做个事后总结。但同时我也想挑战一下，看自己在如此高压环境下能保持几分镇定与平静。毕竟，面试谷歌多么令人激动。

The idea seemed to help me pull out of my tail-spin and I got better throughout the afternoon. By the time I left, I even had a glimmer of hope Google might still offer me a job.这样的想法把我从慌乱状态中解救出来，下午的表现可圈可点。离开的时候，我甚至抱有一丝希望，觉得谷歌会给我offer。

Per my post-mortem habit, I went home and found online resources to help me build a JavaScript promise from scratch. The next day I took three phone screens and the ups-and-downs struck again.根据事后总结的习惯，回到家以后我找到关于JavaScript返回对象的线上资源从零学起。第二天我又参加了三次电话面试，表现有好有坏。

I performed strongly on a call with a security startup. I Embarrassed myself with a small energy startup. And I had the comeback of a lifetime on the phone with Rubrik, a cloud storage unicorn.面试一家安全创业公司时，我表现很好；但面试一家小型能源创业公司时，我表现很差。电话面试Rubrik---一家云存储独角兽公司---又给了我极大的信心。

Rubrik asked another question on promises, harder than the one from the Google interview I had failed a day before. Having done my post-mortem, I innovated on the spot and raced to the finish just as time ran out.Rubrik的面试问题也关于promises，比前一天谷歌面试的还要难。但因为我前一天晚上的总结，现场创新，在面试结束之前刚刚完成。

The interviewer said I may have been the first bootcamp grad the company had ever interviewed — they traditionally hire only from prestigious universities — and he couldn’t believe I wrote my first line of code the summer before. I did a little dance in my room.面试官说我是他们面试的第一个编程训练营出身的人---他们之前只从名校招人---并且他们一点都不相信我从去年夏天才开始写代码。我开心地甚至在房间里跳了几步舞。

The next week, JP Morgan Chase called and offered me $110K/year, with no equity or bonus. I didn’t think it was a cultural fit, and I wasn’t yet at my $120K/year target, but I was thrilled to have my first official offer. Someone was going to pay me to code!过了一周，摩根大通打电话给我，说要录用我，年薪11万美金，不包含股票和奖金。但我觉得我不太适应摩根大通的企业文化，而且这个薪资距离我12万年薪的目标还有差距。但因为这是我的第一个正式offer，我还是特别激动，终于有人雇我写代码了！

I started to handle several calls per day from phone interviewers, recruiters, and advisors, and the often unpredictable ups-and-downs continued. Google called and said on-site results were mixed but I’d be moving to Hiring Committee. Uber offered an on-site. I thought I performed strongly on an Amazon phone screen but didn’t get an on-site. And I thought I blew a Yelp phone screen and got an on-site.我开始一天应付来自面试官、招聘人员和各个顾问的数个电话，结果仍然是有好有坏。谷歌打电话说面试结果仍不明朗，可以去招聘委员会询问；Uber给了我面试机会；我觉得电话面试亚马逊时表现很强劲，但我没有拿到面试机会；我觉得我搞砸了Yelp的电话面试，但我却拿到了面试机会。

As on-sites came and went, I had to watch my words around recruiters. The security startup said they were afraid they wouldn’t be able to keep up with big companies like IBM and JP Morgan Chase and asked what salary offers I had received.在一场场的面试中，我非常注意我面对招聘人员时的措辞。那家安全创业公司说他们担心没有办法给出像IBM和摩根大通一样的薪水，问我拿到的offer开出的薪水是多少。

I almost bit the bait, but paused and  [deflected the salary question][24]  as Hack Reactor instructs.  _“_I’d actually like to go the other way – can you tell me your range and I’ll tell you if you’re in the ballpark?” I said. “Sure, we start at $125K.”我几乎都要上钩了，但我停下来想了想之前黑客反应堆训练营指导过的关于薪水问题的回答方式，于是我说：“其实我觉得不如这样---您告诉我您打算开多少薪资，我看看在不在我的理想范围之内。”“当然可以，我们的薪资起薪是12.5万。”

$125K. That exceeded my goal!12.5万美元！这个数字超出了我的目标！

I looked away hoping to disguise my excitement by making it look like I was thinking about it. I turned back and said calmly,  _“_If that’s your starting point, I think we can have a conversation.” He responded: “Oh good, I’m relieved we’re still in the running!” _Me too,_  I thought.我望向别处来掩盖我激动的心情，装作正在思考。然后我扭过头，镇定地说：“如果这样的话，我想我们可以进一步谈谈。”招聘人员说：“那好，只要还能谈我就放心了。”我也是，我在心里默默想到。

The formal offer was in a few days later: $125K plus $6K/annual in stock options at current valuation. But the money was almost insignificant! It was a good cultural fit, a fascinating back end role, and mentorship opportunities looked unusually strong. The team of ~40 engineers all had at least two years’ experience and were mostly from top schools like MIT, Stanford, or Berkeley. It was everything I wanted!几天后我拿到正式offer：年薪12.5万美元，外加每年当年市值的6000美元的股票期权。但是这些钱根本不重要。我特别中意公司的企业文化，职位也是非常有吸引力的后端开发，还有绝佳的指导机会。团队中40个工程师至少都有两年的工作经验，大部分都来自像麻省理工、斯坦福或者伯克利之类的顶尖名校。这些跟我憧憬的工作都十分契合！

But the offers were just getting started.但这一切，才刚刚开始。

## Negotiating across offers and selecting a company offer三千，只取一瓢

> **"Effective negotiators look past their counterparts’ stated positions and delve into their underlying motivations... they are relentlessly curious." –Chris Voss**高效的谈判者会仔细比较自己收到的所有offer，细细思考自己深层次动力来源……他们拥有无穷的好奇心。-克里斯*沃斯

Rubrik called two days later and shocked me. They wanted me to be their first-ever bootcamp hire too. Rubrik was already valued at $3.3B — a hot new unicorn and coveted place to work by software engineers with plenty of experience. I laughed with the recruiter, overjoyed such a competitive company wanted me, and hung up so excited I almost didn’t realize I had a missed call from Google.两天后Rubrik给我回了电话，我无比惊讶。我也将会是他们雇佣第一个从编程训练营毕业的员工。Rubrik市值早已达到33亿美元，现在是一家炙手可热的新型独角兽公司，还可以和经验丰富的软件工程师一起共事，工作环境让人心动。我回复招聘人员说要考虑一下，其实心里早已乐开了花：这么有竞争力的公司也想要我！挂断电话以后我仍然十分激动，差点忘记自己漏接了Google的电话。

I dialed back with bated breath. The recruiter got right to it: “I just got out of Hiring Committee and wanted to call you right away. We’d like to make you an offer — ”
我深呼吸几下，把电话回拨了过去。招聘人员倒是开门见山：“根据招聘委员会的通知，很开心地通知您被Google录用了。我们开出的薪酬是---”
I couldn’t contain myself. I yelled, jumping into my empty kitchen. Google! The gold standard of software engineering and my hardest interviewer had decided they wanted me! Then she mentioned numbers and things got surreal. $163K all-in: $120 base salary, $18K minimum bonus, and $25K annual in (liquid) equity.
我完全控制不住自己的尖叫声，蹦蹦跳跳进了厨房！天哪！Google！那家软件工程行业的标杆公司！他们的面试官是我整个面试经历中我遇见过的最严厉的！他们决定要我了！之后招聘人员告诉了我公司开出的薪酬，事情变得更加不真实了。年薪16.3万美元，包括：基础工资12万，奖金最低1.8万，每年公司股票2.5万。
$163K.16.3万美元。

_Are you out of your mind?_  I thought. My last tax return declared $77K.  _That is a stupid amount of money._看着自己最近报税单上的7.7万美元，我竟然觉得这笔钱不值一提。我对自己说：你疯了吗？

I took the afternoon off and walked around my neighborhood dancing when I thought nobody was looking and calling family members to share the unbelievable news.我给自己放了一下午的假，想着应该没人看到，便在房子周围抑制不住兴奋地跳来跳去。也给家人打了电话分享这个天大的好消息。

The next morning, I was back to the grind, studying negotiation instead of algorithms. Overnight, the recruiters that had shepherded me through interviews became my counterparts in negotiations. I felt like a lone sheep amidst a pack of wolves – these were professionals and numbers could swing tens of thousands of dollars in conversations that lasted minutes.第二天上午，我又回归到辛苦学习当中。只不过这次不是学习算法，而是学习如何谈判。一夜之间，那些在面试过程中指导我的面试官成为了我在谈判中的对手。我觉得自己就像在狼群中求生存的一只羔羊---周围都是专家大佬，几分钟的谈话之间就可能决定我的薪酬能不能多几千美元。

Initially I feared coming across as greedy, but my Hack Reactor career coach was adamant. She said it was expected, and money aside, it demonstrates thoughtfulness, confidence in difficult conversations, and sets expectations for the first weeks on the job.刚开始我很害怕这样做会让自己显得比较贪婪，但黑客反应堆的教练态度特别坚定。她说这特别正常，谈判不仅仅是为了更高的薪酬。在谈判过程中，一个人有没有认真思考，是否自信都可以在谈判过程中得到显现。同时也会让老板对你刚进入公司时的工作有所期待。

I saw almost a 90% increase in compensation by waiting and passing on my first offer我发现基本90%的工资上涨都是因为有我第一份工作开出薪酬的比较。

The next few days flew by in a flurry of phone calls with recruiters and advisors, studying, preparing, and conducting post-mortems on negotiations. I wrote one-pagers anticipating every negotiation and conducted post-mortems on what went well and what did not, similar to how I reflected on failed interviews.接下来的几天，都在跟招聘人员和顾问电话沟通中度过，不断学习为谈判做准备，也在谈判后及时复盘吸取经验。我把希望在谈判中呈现出的内容写在了一页纸上，每次谈判过后也会反思哪部分进行得好，哪部分有待提升，就像我之前复盘面试失败教训一样。

I learned to love it. Each conversation was a fascinating puzzle, with layers ranging from high-level strategy, like when and how I shared information, to moment-to-moment tactics, like my tone of voice. It was especially fun to have so many at-bats – I would sometimes talk to multiple recruiters in a single day, each phone call doubling as another opportunity to try out new skills and learn from mistakes.我学着去爱上这个过程。每次谈判中都会出现不同的令人着迷同时也令人困惑的问题，涉及层面多样，例如高水平策略方面：我分享信息的时间和方式；例如当下策略方面：我应该用什么样的语气。能解决这么多的问题非常有趣。有时我能在一天当中跟数个招聘人员聊天，每次电话沟通既能让我练习新学到的谈判技巧，同时也能让我重新积累教训。

I had read Harvard Negotiation Project’s  _Getting to the Yes_ and  _Getting Past the No_  in college and was familiar with concepts like BATNA and win-win solutions. But I took most of my inspiration from Chris Voss’s  _Never Split the Difference_, which I re-read immediately after Google’s offer.读大学时我就读完了哈佛大学谈判项目的两本书：《谋求共识》（getting to the yes）和《克服分歧》（getting past the no），对谈判协议最佳替代方案（BATNA）和双赢解决方案之类的概念非常熟悉。但我还是从克里斯*沃斯的《掌控谈话》（never split the difference）中获得的灵感最多。拿到Google的offer以后我又把这本书读了一遍。

I also scoured blog posts by  [Haseeb Qureshi][25], another earn-to-give bootcamp graduate, and chatted regularly with my Hack Reactor career coach who had advised hundreds of negotiations before mine.另外，我还阅读了哈西卜*库雷西写的所有博客，他也是训练营毕业，把赚来的钱都贡献了出去。我也会时常跟训练营的职业教练沟通，在我之前，她有着成百上千的谈判指导经验。

Rubrik’s first offer came in at $163K, matching Google perfectly. Then Yelp called with the latest plot twist. They “leveled-up” my application to a non-entry level role and offered me $160K plus a $20K sign-on bonus for $180K all-in first-year compensation.Rubrik刚开始薪酬报价是16.3万美元，跟Google不相上下。之后，Yelp打电话过来，上演了剧情大逆转。他们把我申请的职位提升到一个非初级岗，然后给我开出了16万美元的年薪，另外还有2万美元的入职奖金---第一年总共18万美元。

$180K and a non-entry level role?18万美元和非初级岗。怎么样？

I put on my very best performance at my Yelp interview — finishing every challenge with time to spare, adapting code seamlessly to meet new constraints, and making remarks about systems architecture using back-of-the-envelope calculations that seemed to surprise my interviewer. But that didn’t change the fact I had zero experience! Google and Rubrik immediately said they’d prepare a counter offer.我在Yelp面试中表现出了自己的最好水平---在给定时间内完成了所有任务，为满足新的约束条件重新调整了代码使之无缝衔接，运用保守计算评估了系统架构。面试官甚至都因此感到吃惊。但这些并不能改变我没有任何工作经验的事实。Google和Rubrik马上就回复说他们会调整薪水。

Finally the job search climaxed.最终，找工作的最高潮部分来了。

Lyft emailed asking to get on the phone. Lyft was by far my favorite interview experience, but I didn’t believe my on-site performance merited an offer. I conceptually solved one interview almost immediately, but never got my code to work. I pulled off a late comeback in another but failed to submit as time expired. Stretched thin across multiple rounds of daily negotiations, I responded with this exact email:Lyft发邮件说要电话沟通。迄今为止，我的面试最好体验就来自Lyft，但我觉得我的面试表现不能让我拿到他们的offer。面试时我几乎是立马就想出了解决方案，但写的代码却始终没有运行出来。后来我又想出一个改进办法，但超时了没有提交成功。每天车轮般的协商工作让我身心俱疲，所以我回复给Lyft的邮件如下：

_“I’m juggling a handful of different calls right now. Do you mind breaking the news by email? I’m guessing it’s a rejection, in which case I would love to get 1-2 sentences of feedback from each interview. Other than that, thank you for your time and shepherding me through the process!”_“我现在在和好几家公司沟通。您介不介意用邮件直接通知我结果呢？我大概猜到我应该没有通过面试，但即便这样，我还是想从每次面试中获得一两句评价反馈，麻烦您了。感谢您百忙之中抽出空来对我进行指导。”

She responded with one line:  _“It’s not a rejection :)”_Lyft的回复只有一行：“你通过面试了。”

_What! Would no company reject me?_  I couldn’t believe my top choice was back on the table. We talked numbers the next day: $210K all-in.什么？我通过面试了？我简直不敢相信我以为已经没有希望的最中意选择竟然兜兜转转回来了！第二天，我们谈定了薪酬：所有七七八八加起来年薪21万美元。

$210K.21万美元。

And to think that was Lyft, where I would have loved to work, money aside! A couple of my friends at Lyft were some of my favorite people — harder to say if they were kinder than they were brilliant or vice versa — and my interviewers seemed cut from the same cloth.想一想，这可是Lyft！这是我朝思暮想可以工作的公司，工资什么的一点都不重要。几个在Lyft工作的朋友是我最喜欢的其中一部分人---很难说他们的善良程度是不是比聪明程度更高---我的面试官们似乎也如出一辙。

I informed everyone a last minute offer had been made and set a decision deadline for one week, encouraging everyone to make their final offers. I was getting worn down in constant negotiations, I felt a deadline would professionally bound the time everyone was investing in my candidacy, and Voss suggests deadlines can be used to your advantage.和Lyft确定薪酬后，我告知了每个正在沟通的公司，并且告诉他们我有最后一周的考虑时间，想鼓励他们给出最终确定薪酬。持续不断的谈判让我身心俱疲，我认为有截止期限在，可以大大减少每个公司在我身上投入的时间。沃斯也建议说，截止期限可以作为杀手锏使出。

Google had prepared $189K to come in over Yelp, but said it would come back again given news about Lyft. Rubrik agreed to get on the phone. Yelp and and the security startup said they couldn’t negotiate further, and  was no longer keeping JP Morgan Chase or IBM up to speed. Uber, my only other onsite, did not make me an offer.Google给出了18.9万美元的薪酬，高于Yelp的报价，并且表示会根据Lyft的报价重新作出调整。Rubrik同意电话沟通。Yelp和那家安全创业公司表示不会继续沟通。我也不打算继续跟进摩根大通和IBM。Uber，虽然给了我面试机会，却并没有给我发offer。

The Lyft team had me for lunch and I swooned. Teams at Google, Yelp, and the security startup were enjoyable, but 9 people took time out of their day to lunch with me at Lyft, laughing as if I were already part of the team. They wanted to staff me on the company’s number one 2019 priority and a senior engineer told me he would happily serve as a mentor. Lyft was also months away from an IPO.Lyft团队邀我共进午餐，我受宠若惊。不管是Google、Yelp还是安全创业公司的团队都让人特别舒服，但是Lyft团队出了九个人跟我一起吃午饭，气氛十分融洽，笑声不断，好像我早就已经是团队中的一份子。他们说想找我进公司是2019年公司的头等大事。一名高级工程师表示他十分乐意做我的导师。此时距离Lyft首次公开募股的日期，已经没有几个月了。

I had it all: mentorship, opportunity in a high-growth environment, a people-first culture, exciting work, and now outrageously high compensation.在Lyft，我什么都有了：导师指导、快速成长环境、以人为本的企业文化、令人激动的工作以及现在如此之高的薪酬。

Rubrik didn’t counter offer in time, but Google came in at $233K, $216K before their 401(k) match and charity match programs (which I consider good as cash since I  [earn-to-give][26]  and will be donating 25% of my pre-tax income this year). The team was also a good cultural fit, and Google is world-class in developing junior engineers into top talent.Rubrik没有及时给出薪酬报价。Google最后的报价是23.3万美元

I grappled with the decision for days, wavering between Google and Lyft, but gradually growing confident that, compensation aside, Lyft was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up. I negotiated a final package of $226 all-in compensation: $135K base salary, $71K in equity at pre-IPO valuation, and $20K sign-on bonus. On Monday, February 25, 245 days after my first line of code, I spoke the two words that brought it all to a close: “I accept.”我纠结了数天，在Google和Lyft之间摇摆不定。但慢慢地我越来越相信，抛开薪酬不谈，Lyft绝对是我不能错过的机会。经过最后谈判，Lyft的薪酬定在了22.6万美元，包括13.5万美元的基本工资，IPO之前价值7.1万的股票，和2万美元的入职奖金。2月25号，是个周四。距离我写下我的第一行代码过去245天的时候，我接受了Lyft的offer，作为这一段求职旅程的结束。

Six months later, I couldn’t be happier working at Lyft. And to my delight, my morning reflection was dead on. My team is supportive, my work fascinating, and my compensation strong, but the priceless reward of becoming an engineer was falling in love with learning. Now that I’m in love, I don’t intend to leave it.在Lyft工作的六个月，是我最开心的工作时光。让我开心的是，我的晨间冥想是一个十分正确的决定。团队互相扶持，工作内容吸引人，薪酬待遇也好。但是就成为一名工程师而言，宝贵之处在于，我爱上了学习。既然我已经为学习痴迷，我就不打算与它分离。

## [In search of software engineering roles?][27]

I've curated the list of top resources I used to prep for interviews. I'm also offering coaching sessions to job seekers that commit 10% or more of their future income to high impact charities. **Get access to both  [here][28].**

Note: I write with a pen name to maintain a little separation between my personal life and growing presence as a job search coach.

I shared specific compensation information in this article for two reasons. One, I want this post to be as useful as possible to job seekers from non-traditional backgrounds, many of whom may be less familiar with these numbers. And two, because  [sharing our salaries][29]  is a concrete way to fight pay inequality that hurts everyone,  [especially minorities][30].

Fighting pay inequality is also aligned with the mission and culture of Lyft, which is extraordinarily committed to fighting pay inequality. It administers a third-party pay equity audit every year, and this past year Lyft became a different kind of “unicorn” in Silicon Valley after  [no systemic pay gap was found][31]. Precise salary information already exists on sites like  [paysa][32],  [levels][33], and  [blind][34], so details shared here are nothing new.

Finally, I'm grateful for the support of many on this journey, especially Lena Johnson, my job search coach and negotiation advisor, and Robin Kim, my technical mentor. Thank you!
